# Instructions
This notebook is for the [Kaggle COMP 551 Winter 2019 Mini Project 3 Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/comp-551-w2019-project-3-modified-mnist).<br>

## Dependencies
You will need the following packages:
numpy, pandas, matplotlib.pyplot, pickle, torch, torchvision.transforms, sklearn.metrics.accuracy_score

## Data Loading
The notebook was downloaded from a Kaggle kernel used to make submissions.
There are two options for running the notebook.<br><br>
If you'd like to run the notebook locally you'll need to download the data directly from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/comp-551-w2019-project-3-modified-mnist/data).<br>
Furthermore, your training data, training labels, and test data need to be available under the following formats relative to this current directory: 
`../input/train_images.pkl`, `../input/train_labels.csv`, `../input/test_images.pkl`.<br><br>
The second option is by creating a new kernel under the competition and use the upload feature to upload the notebook code to your new kernel, giving you access to the data.
This would be an easier option.
